This is the second part of the assignment 3(Central Limit Theorem)
The assignment consists of various files that are described as follows with
results:
1. CentralLimit.java/class: This program computes the value of zeta according
to the given formulae and finds the mean and variance of the distribution as follows:  
Mean:-2.228073128277864E-4
Variance:0.0034095426294746276

2. zeta_distribution.dat: This file holds the distribution output from the
above program.

3. zeta_dist.eps: This file shows the distribution which is indeed a normal plot.
